Musician, for S60 3rd Edition smartphones, v3.2

- tuning notes for guitar
- visual and audible metronome
- (not very) playable mini-piano

This is a piece of Python code that I've been playing around with for ages in odd moments. Note that I'm not a Python wizard. Thanks to William F. Dudley Jr. (who IS a Python wizard) for helping fine tune (sic) some of the code!

-----------------
To install it:

1)Install Python (self-signed) for 3rd Edition from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155

    [note that if you have a TI-2420 accelerator chip in your phone, choose this version etc. If you don't know (as is likely), just go with the generic S60 3rd Edition etc.]

2)Install Python Script shell (self-signed) for 3rd Edition from the same place

    [That's Python installed and you can now create your own apps or run any other S60-specific Python scripts you come across]

3)Copy the \Python and \Musician folders from this archive onto your smartphone's expansion card, either using PC Suite or with a card reader/writer


-----------------
To run Musician, start Python (in 'My own' or 'Applications' or 'Installations', normally) and use the menu option:

'Run script' and pick 'Musician.py'


-----------------
Musician is now Open Source - it's free, you should never be charged for it - and if you're a Python wizard who can help improve the code further, get in touch!
